## Android_Precise_Location

This Android project helps you retrieve user location data with a focus on precision. It's tested with devices running Android 5.0 (API level 21) to Android 14 (API level 34).

**Features:**

* **Prioritizes Precise Location:** Utilizes the Fused Location Provider API (FLP) to leverage various location providers (GPS, Wi-Fi, Cell towers) for the most accurate location data possible.
* **Fallback Mechanism:** If FLP encounters issues, the project employs LocationManager as a backup to ensure location retrieval even in challenging scenarios.
* **User Choice (Android 12+):**  For devices running Android 12 (API level 31) and later, users can choose between "Precise" (prioritizes GPS) and "Approximate" (uses less battery-intensive methods) location options.

**Getting Started**

(Provide instructions on setting up and using the project)

**Explanation of Options**

* **Precise:** This option prioritizes using GPS for the most accurate location data. It might consume slightly more battery power.
* **Approximate (Android 12+):** This option utilizes less battery-intensive methods like network-based location, which might be less precise than GPS but can still be useful for many use cases.

**Why the Fallback Mechanism?**

In some situations, FLP might not be able to retrieve location data due to factors like disabled location services or lack of GPS signal. The fallback to LocationManager helps ensure location data availability even in such scenarios.

**Note:**
Employs LocationManager as a backup to FLP in case of unexpected issues or disabled location services. While it might take up to 1 minute to acquire a location and may have limitations in rare scenarios like fetching under dense buildings, it enhances overall reliability.
